## Real-Time Banking Data Platform

This architecture ingests real-time banking transactions using AWS Kinesis, processes them with AWS Glue, stores raw data in S3 and structured data in Redshift, catalogs metadata with Glue Catalog, and enforces governance using IAM, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch.
"""
This platform is ideal for a banking institution that needs to:

Ingest high-velocity transaction data (real-time payments, transfers)

Process and clean it for analytics or fraud detection

Store both raw and cleaned data for compliance and BI

Enforce data governance and security standards

Monitor the data pipeline health continuously

## MODULE EXPLANATION
## data_ingestion/
   Lambda: process_transaction_lambda.py decodes Kinesis records and logs transactions.

Kinesis: create_kinesis_stream.py sets up a stream for real-time ingestion.

✅ Business Value: Enables real-time streaming of banking transactions like withdrawals, deposits, etc.

## data_storage/
   S3: s3_bucket_setup.py creates a raw data lake.

Redshift: create_redshift_tables.sql defines schema to store processed data.

✅ Business Value: Stores data in a cost-efficient lake and high-performance warehouse for analytics.

## data_processing/
   Glue ETL: etl_transaction_processing.py reads JSON from S3, transforms it, and loads it into Redshift.

✅ Business Value: Converts raw JSON into structured, queryable transaction records.

## data_catalog/
   Glue Catalog: create_glue_catalog_table.py registers schema metadata for discoverability.

✅ Business Value: Enables analysts and BI tools to query S3 datasets with Athena or Redshift Spectrum.

## data_governance/
   Access Policy: s3_access_policy.json restricts data access.

Audit Logging: enable_cloudtrail_logging.py enables AWS CloudTrail for auditing.

✅ Business Value: Ensures data access is secure and fully auditable — critical for regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS).

## infrastructure/terraform/
   Terraform: main.tf deploys Kinesis and S3 infrastructure as code.

✅ Business Value: Consistent, automated provisioning of infrastructure in dev/test/prod.

## security/
   IAM Role: glue_execution_role.json grants least-privilege permissions to Glue jobs.

✅ Business Value: Enforces principle of least privilege and prevents accidental data exposure.

## monitoring/
   CloudWatch: setup_cloudwatch_alarms.py alerts on failed Kinesis ingestions.

✅ Business Value: Early detection of pipeline failures ensures continuous data availability.

## scripts/
   Orchestration: orchestrate_pipeline.py automates setup: stream, catalog, logging.

✅ Business Value: Reduces manual errors and speeds up environment readiness.

## docs/
    Architecture Overview: Summarizes the full data pipeline.

✅ Business Value: Helps teams understand data flow, reducing onboarding and troubleshooting time.

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS
Scalable: Uses AWS native services to scale as volume grows.

Secure: Implements fine-grained access, audit trails.

Real-time: Capable of processing transactions with minimal latency.

Compliant: Auditing and access controls support financial regulations.

Modular: Easily extendable with fraud detection, alerting, or dashboards.
